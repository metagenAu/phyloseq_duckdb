\title{Prune specific taxa from a phyloseq object using DuckDB}
\usage{
prune_taxa_duckdb(taxa, physeq, keep = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa}{Character vector of taxa IDs to keep (if keep = TRUE) or remove (if keep = FALSE)}

\item{physeq}{A phyloseq_duckdb object}

\item{keep}{Logical, if TRUE keep only the specified taxa, if FALSE remove them}
}
\value{
A new phyloseq_duckdb object with pruned taxa
}
\description{
This function removes specified taxa from a phyloseq object, efficiently
using DuckDB's indexing and filtering capabilities. This is particularly
useful for removing unwanted taxa or focusing on a specific subset.
}
\examples{
# Keep only specific taxa
taxa_to_keep <- c("Firmicutes", "Bacteroidetes")
ps_pruned <- prune_taxa_duckdb(taxa_to_keep, ps, keep = TRUE)

# Remove specific taxa
taxa_to_remove <- c("Unclassified", "Unknown")
ps_pruned <- prune_taxa_duckdb(taxa_to_remove, ps, keep = FALSE)
}
